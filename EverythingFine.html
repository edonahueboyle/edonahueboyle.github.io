    <p>In the middle of McMaster University's campus sits a most interesting art installation - one where climbing is not only not prohibited, but encouraged.</p>
    <p><a href="https://museum.mcmaster.ca/ernest-daetwylers-the-boat-project-returns/">The Boat Project/everythingwillbefine</a>, a sculpture by Ernest     Daetwyler, is a 27-foot-long boat constructed from Lake Huron driftwood. At first glance, it seems not a very useful boat. For one thing, it's anchored in a grassy field, hundreds of metres from anything resembling an open water source. For another, it's full of holes - so you wouldn't get far in it, even if you tried.</p>
    <p>So: what's the point of a boat that doesn't float?</p>
    <p>As it turns out, there are plenty of them. Datwyler encourages the viewer to "contemplate questions about time, memory, flux, and uncertainty." Climbing into the boat, you see the campus, and the world, from a different angle.</p>
    <p>What's the use of a boat that goes nowhere? It's a place to share dinner in a last-ditch attempt to spend a rapidly expiring university meal plan, a place to have a snowball fight on a night when your class was cancelled due to inclement weather, a place to take a friend who wants to see everything on campus before she graduates. It's a place where you travel a different world - the one that comes to you while you're standing still. A world of friendship, of wonder, of the ordinary moments that make life most extraordinary.</p> 
    <p>Even when travelling very far distances, there sits the boat, firmly anchored to the ground, and reminding you: the best destination is the one full of love. Friendship is the finest journey of all. There is beauty in the simplest of places when you are willing to consider them from a different perspective.</p>
    <p>It's a most excellent sculpture. Everything will, indeed, be fine. Thank you, Mr. Daetwyler, for bulding a boat well worth visiting.</p>
