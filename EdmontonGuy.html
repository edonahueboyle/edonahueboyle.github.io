    <p>In May of 2023, I disembarked the train in a station on the outskirts of Edmonton, where I experienced Alberta for the first time: walking almost two kilometres to the nearest bus stop, in the tall grass, along a six-lane highway, as ash gently fell from the sky. Welcome to wildfire season.</p>
    <p>On the bus into town I saw a man whom I was certain had come from the train. He looked like an average European backpacker in his late twenties, and I thought nothing much of it. It surprised me not at all to watch him disembark at the same stop as me and head into the hostel. I was sure that this kind of thing happened all the time, and went about my business in Edmonton.</p>
    <p>About a week later, having moved on to Banff, I stood at a bus stop waiting for a ride back to my hidey-hole when I saw a very familiar close-shaven head. Fifteen feet from me stood the gentleman from Edmonton, and, sure enough, he boarded the bus and rode with me back to the hostel. I ran into him on my way to the shower later that night.</p>
    <p>That was a little odd, but stranger things have happened. I chuckled a little and forgot all about it.</p>
    <p>UNTIL!</p>
    <p>Four days later I sat in the train station in Jasper, waiting for my final connection to Vancouver. Was sitting having a lovely conversation with a retired schoolteacher from England when I saw that same head walk by towards the check-in counter. There, again, was the man I quickly christened Edmonton Guy. What are the odds! We rode to Vancouver together, and I vowed that if I ran into him again I was going to ask him what on earth motivated him to take a trip with exactly the same timing.</p>
    <p>Well, I never saw him again, but of all the people I encountered while traveling across Western Canada, he was by far the most memorable. If ever I see him again, I'll be sure to ask him to swap itineraries!</p>
