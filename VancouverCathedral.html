    <p>One of the greatest joys, and greatest stressors, of being a travelling Catholic is finding a local church to attend. There are so many options! The one closest to the hostel? The cathedral? Perhaps, in a large city, the parish named after a saint to whom you have a particular devotion? And once you've picked a location, the other worries begin: am I over- or under-dressed? Did I bring enough money for a donation? How early should I arrive to secure a good seat?</p>
    <p>(An aside: everyone's definition of a "good seat" is slightly different. For many, it's probably a pew with a view. But I'm shy, and, as a visitor, am very wary of taking a local's seat, so I prefer to hang out in a back corner. As long as you're in the church, how can there be a bad seat?)</p>
    <p>This is how I found myself sitting in the back left corner of Vancouver's <a href="https://www.holyrosarycathedral.org">Holy Rosary Cathedral</a> at 10 AM on a late spring Sunday. Getting there had been a misadventure - walking up from the waterfront, I was very confused to find a Costco parking lot where Google Maps told me the church should have been! It took about 20 minutes to spot a staircase leading to an elevated road - as it turned out, the church was on a higher road. That wasn't obvious from a one-dimensional map!</p>      <p>I arrived at the church out of breath and slightly frazzled, but still about an hour early. It was almost vacant; only a few people say in the pews and it was unclear whether they lingered after an earlier mass or were waiting for the one I was to attend. Above in the loft, the choir practiced. Sunlight streamed in through gorgeous stained-glass windows. It was an excellent opportunity to sit quietly and appreciate a beautiful day.</p>

    <p>A sharp intake of breath and the sound of stamping feet wrested me from my thoughts. Turning to look, I saw a friend from McMaster, with whom I had attended countless masses at <a href="https://www.canadianmartyrshamilton.com">Canadian Martyrs</a> in Hamilton. I had known she was in Vancouver, but figured the odds of actually seeing her in a city of almost three million were slim to none. Surely, there were hundreds of masses in Vancouver that morning, and yet somehow we had ended up at the same one. What a fantastic coincidence!</p>
    <p>(A second aside, pursuant to the first: This friend has much more confidence than I and brought me to the front of the church with her. We had a <em>very</em> good view that day, though secretly I longed for the breathing room at the back. But how can you complain about a packed church?)</p>
    <p>Later that night, in one of the more surreal experiences of my life, I sat on a patio eating seafood chowder with a friend from a home over 4000 km away. No plans had been made. We just happened to be two Catholics on vacation, and that fact alone resulted in a miracle.</p>
