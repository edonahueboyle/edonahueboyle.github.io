    <p>Libraries provide an essential public service. Beyond offering reading material, they are often a place for the weary traveller to warm up, cool off, access the internet, ask for directions, or simply get off their feet for an hour.</p>
    <p>The local library is one of my favourite stops when I visit a new city. Libraries are often very culturally relevant and the architecture, particularly that of main branches in large cities, is phenomenal (Calgary and Halifax have two of the greatest). But the small-town library is every bit as much of a cultural staple, and often offers a friendlier touch when a visitor needs to get something done.</p>
