    <p>"There's no way you can hear the crowd cheering from all the way up there."</p>
    <p>So said my father, quite bluntly, when I told him that I stood on Mountain Brow Boulevard on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon in late September and heard the cheers of a Tiger-Cats home crowd echoing up from the city below.</p>
    <p>Two details are salient hee. First: for those unfamiliar with Hamilton geography, the city is divided in half by the Niagara Escarpment, a cliff-like geological feature. The stadium is in the lower city; I stood way above on what locals call 'the Mountain,' but what is really more like a hill. Still, the upper city is well enough away that sound would have to cover a great distance before it reached my ears.</p>
    <p>Second: Hamiltonians <em><strong>love</strong></em> TiCats football.</p>
    <p>As children, my brother and I were taught that going to Hamilton meant that you cheered for the Tiger-Cats, no matter who was playing - and you wouldn't dream of wearing anything remotely blue (the colour of the much-reviled rival Toronto Argonauts). Living in the city, you will quickly learn that football is a cultural staple. Everyone wears jerseys on game days. The tellers in the credit union want your take on the new quarterback acquisition. "OSKEE-WEE-WEE!" flashes the special bus that shuttles ticket-holding fans to the game free of charge.</p>
    <p>The context now set, we may return to the issue of whether the crowd was audible from the Mountain.</p>
    <p>It was fall of 2022. In the summer of that year, I rode my bike to the east end and sat outside the stadium for the first home game to welcome a live crowd since the pandemic began. When the team was introduced at that game, the sound of the crowd moved me to tears with its overwhelming <em>happiness</em>. There, at last, were thousands of enthusiastic people enjoying their city's favourite pastime. Isolation begone!</p>
    <p>With this in mind, I remain totally convinced that the roar I heard from the Mountain was, in fact, that very same happy crowd. Because if there was anywhere in the country where football fans could be heard halfway across the city, it would be Hamilton. That enthusiasm is part of what makes the city so special.</p>
