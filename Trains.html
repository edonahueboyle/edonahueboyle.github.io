  <p>Trains... they're everywhere! Canada has passenger rail running coast-to-coast, as well as municipal light rail, commuter rail lines around Southern Ontario, and intercity service along the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. For your convenience, these have been divided into separate categories.</p>

      <p>The <em>Canadian</em> is probably Canada's finest rail experience. This VIA Rail-operated train travels for four days between Toronto, ON and Vancouver, BC, passing through Northern Ontario, the Prairies, and the stunning Rocky Mountains before arriving at the Pacific Ocean. I took this train over three weeks in May of 2023, hopping off to explore in a variety of places.

      <p>Looking to go to the East Coast? The <em>Ocean</em> is a very good option. Also operated by VIA Rail, this journey from Montreal, QC to Halifax, NS takes just over 24 hours. I took this trip over New Years of 2024, meaning the days were a little short for taking in the gorgeous scenery of eastern Quebec - but allowing for great views of the Christmas lights bedecking the small towns! The 2 by 1 configuration of Economy class also makes this trip a great option for solo travellers. Read more about the <em>Ocean</em> <a href="TheOcean.html">here</a>.</p>
