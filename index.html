  <p>Someone I love once told me that not having a car helps you make a lot more friends. What he didn't mention is that you also get up to a lot more crazy adventures!</p>
  <p>I am twenty-two years old and recently finished undergraduate studies in Hamilton. Born and raised in Ottawa, I grew up riding all over the city on the NCC bikepaths and, later, on the OC Transpo system (which is wonderful, when it works...). As a student, I suddenly encountered a life where there was no car at all - meaning that it was time to, quite literally, stand on my own two feet! Over the past few years, I have become intimately acquainted with the Hamilton Street Railway, the GO Transit system that holds Southern Ontario together, and VIA, the national rail service. I have traveled across Canada on the train and experienced public transit in Halifax, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver. Soon I will travel beyond Canada to explore even more of the world from the passenger seat.</p>
