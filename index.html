  <p>Someone I love once told me that not having a car helps you make a lot more friends. What he didn't mention is that you also get up to a lot more crazy adventures!</p>
  <p>I am twenty-two years old and recently finished undergraduate studies in Hamilton. Born and raised in Ottawa, I grew up riding all over the city on the NCC bikepaths and, later, on the OC Transpo system (which is wonderful, when it works...). As a student, I suddenly encountered a life where there was no car at all - meaning that it was time to, quite literally, stand on my own two feet! Over the past few years, I have become intimately acquainted with the Hamilton Street Railway, the GO Transit system that holds Southern Ontario together, and VIA, the national rail service. I have traveled across Canada on the train and experienced public transit in Halifax, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver. Soon I will travel beyond Canada to explore even more of the world from the passenger seat.</p>
  <p>I love the car-free life. It forces you to learn to get around in creative ways, to problem-solve, and to meet people on the streets and in the bus stations. On this page, I share adventures undertaken on transit, ranging from the sublime (seeing the Rocky Mountains for the first time) to the ridiculous (marching a mattress across the city on Canada Day). These tales are written not to cast judgement on cars - I will probably buy one, when life demands it - but to shine a light on all the fun you can have in what seems to be an automobile-dependent world.</p>
  <p>I hope you will enjoy these stories. A brief note: unlike a conventional blog, the tales I tell are anecdotal rather than chronological - but I will provide timeframes for each story. If you are interested in reading the latest releases, you will find them below. I publish at least once a week, so be sure to check back regularly! Otherwise, please use the categories provided to select topics that are of interest to you.</p>
