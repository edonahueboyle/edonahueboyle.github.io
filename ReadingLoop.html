    <p>It’s been a long while since last I wrote.</p>
    <p>There are times in life when you need a new, consistent hobby. Over the past few months, I have learned that the trifecta of losing a parent, moving to a different country, and starting a PhD does not create an environment overly conducive to energy for ambitious creative endeavours. My life looks very different now than when I left Canada. I am far quieter, and more reserved, and have experienced things I never thought possible. I learned what it was to forget your reason to live. I learned what it was to be unable to will yourself to do all the things you remember, at one point, having loved.</p>
    <p>Trauma. That’s what they call it, when suddenly everything in your world is standing on its head and you don’t know what way is up anymore. In my case, it was the unbidden arrival of stability. I was used to carrying the world on my shoulders and didn’t understand what it meant to put down that mantle. If I wasn’t desperately working to prevent the inevitable catastrophe, who was I?</p>
    <p>It was a terribly confusing time. Trials by fire have a way of burning through you, and sometimes they steal the parts of yourself that you most dearly loved.</p>
    <p>For me, one of the most difficult losses was the disappearance of my ability to read. As a child, I was an avid reader; it was my escape from the world, a window into a thousand dreams I could experience through my imagination. Growing up, I lost that. Loss of sleep, loss of time, a crazy rat race where I had to work my tail off because I was still running from the past.</p>
    <p>Before I left Canada, one of my best friends asked me if I was going to spend more time reading when I moved to New Zealand.</p>
    <p>“I will, probably, for the first few months,” said I, “until I find some friends and get busy living a life.”</p>
    <p>In fact, the opposite proved to be true. My overactive brain – a symptom, I have learned, of the kind of stress it was forced to endure – interjected into everything I tried to read. I couldn’t focus on a page for much more than five minutes before it would rudely interrupt and tell me that I needed to GET BACK TO WORK NOW. This made the early stages of a PhD rather difficult.</p>
    <p>The loss of my reading brain scared me. I feared cognitive decline, feared the loss of something I loved, feared that I would never be able to recover. For months, all I read were children’s books and poetry anthologies, things that required little mental stamina and could be relatively easily set aside. It wasn’t a waste; during this time, I discovered Iain S. Thomas, who I venture is one of the finest authors of our time. But I longed after the novel, after the non-fiction I used to devour.</p>
    <p>In truth, my brain is not yet back, and I still find it difficult to just sit and be, though I am working on it and slowly making progress. In terms of reading, though, the bus has been my salvation.</p>
    <p>Auckland is blessed with some truly wonderful public transit routes. I have learned how to maximize a 3.70 NZD fare for what I call the “Reading Loop:” from Britomart, take the Western Line train to New Lynn (about 30 minutes), then transfer to the 67A bus to Otahuhu. This milk run – which has the added benefit of no stop announcements – leads onto the Eastern Line train, which can be ridden inward to Panmure before transferring to the 70 bus back to the CBD. In total, this loop takes about three hours.</p>
    <p>Last weekend, I rode that loop twice, and I brought a book with me. It wasn’t anything particularly high-minded; I had checked out, on a whim, a speculative, futuristic thriller entitled Nexus, by Ramez Naam. What amazed me was that, on the bus, I could read. The movement soothed my brain – tricked me, almost, into thinking that I was doing something, and so I could at last relax and focus. I wasn’t going anywhere, except on a journey with that book. In fact, I liked the experience so much that I took another ride on Thursday night just to finish it off. Well worth the money spent. </p>
    <p>I have always enjoyed transit, the feeling of going somewhere, of the unique situation you find yourself in when you are between where you were and where you're going. If anything, the buses were my one constant; even in the darkest days, I would ride around on transit just to get out of the house, to have done something. I’m very grateful that they also provided a route back to my other loves.</p>
    <p>The future is bright. There are so many people left to love, so many places yet to see, so much left to learn about this miraculous experience called life. And sometimes, the buses help you get to the destinations you most need to visit – even the ones within your own psyche.</p>
