  <h1 id="article-title">Hamilton, ON</h1>
  <p>Hamilton is a city very dear to my heart - I lived here for four years while completing my undergraduate degree at McMaster. If you are a Mac student looking for tips on getting around, this is the place for you - have a poke around to learn about good hiking and biking routes, how best to run errands and get to appointments, and the most <em>wonderful</em> bus in the world!</p>
