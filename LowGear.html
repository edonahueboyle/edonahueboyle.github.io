    <p>It’s my first rainy Saturday morning in Auckland, and I’ve gone for a bike ride, because that’s what I do on Saturdays.</p>
    <p>I’ve been in town a week; buying a bike was one of my first priorities. I’ve joked to a friend that cycling is basically my anti-depressant medication: stick me on a two-wheeled machine in the fresh air for a couple of hours and my misery is gone. In the wake of my father’s suicide, I rode from Hamilton to Toronto – a distance of roughly 80 kilometres – to cope with the loss and keep myself out of trouble.</p>
    <p>But let’s return to the bike itself for a moment. It’s a blue, refurbished mountain bike, and it’s certainly showing its age. I had to replace the chain because it snapped off the first day I rode it. But it’s fast, and sturdy, and it will do, if only as a vehicle for a transitional period until I am better established.</p>
    <p>This morning, I rode that bike out and got my first true taste of the Auckland terrain. I used to complain about the hills in Hamilton: no longer. The whole 20-kilometre ride – aside from a brief, flat stint along the seawall – seemed an incessant onslaught of slopes.</p>
    <p>That meant a lot of gear changes. I’m not fond of the gearshifts on this bike – they’re those ones built into the handlebars, which I haven’t used since I was too young to ride in the rain. About three-quarters of the way into the ride, whether from wet hands or mechanical failure, I found that the front gears were stuck in the lowest setting. Strain though I might – blistering my left thumb in the process – I could not increase their intensity.</p>
    <p>For the gears to be stuck in the lowest setting was providential. So steep are the hills in Auckland that I would have been unable to ride home had they chosen to lock themselves any higher. It was irritating, however, to move along the flat ground at a snail’s pace. The lowest gear, on level ground, is easy and slow – two adjectives I despise both in cycling and in life.</p>
    <p>So as I crawled, drenched, back home, I had plenty of time to think. All my life, I’ve operated at two speeds: sprint, or off. The past two years of dealing with my childhood experiences have challenged that, and my father’s death really upended my world. What if, thought I, the gears were a metaphor for my life? I’m older now. Loss has changed me. Maybe I can’t just power through everything anymore. Maybe I have to slow down a little, and appreciate that easy will still get the job done.</p>
    <p>It’s entirely possible that on a drier day, when my hands are bandaged and no longer raw, I will find myself perfectly capable of changing those gears. And perhaps when my spirit is healed, I will have the capacity to bear more weight. Maybe, however, the intensity will never be what it once was. After all, I’m no longer a child. I had my youth, and then I had a second one. Now I’m an adult and need to figure out what that means. How will I manage having to slow down?</p>
    <p>Perhaps just by understanding that there are more options than sprint and off. The lower gear is perfectly okay: the best speed, no matter how slow, is the one that sees you safely home.</p>
