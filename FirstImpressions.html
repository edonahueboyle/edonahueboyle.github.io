    <p>The commonly used descriptor of ‘culture shock’ doesn’t seem to apply well when moving from Canada to New Zealand: everything is very similar to how it is at home and is more a variation on a theme than something completely new. But the differences are still fascinating, and, in some cases, take some time to wrap your head around! Here are ten of the most surprising differences you might notice in your first week in New Zealand.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Everything is on the left. </strong>Yes, cars drive on the left side of the road, but this completely re-orients many things you wouldn’t immediately consider. When walking down the street, if someone is coming, you are expected to dart to the left. Upon arrival at the downtown train station, I almost walked onto the wrong escalator because the one I wanted was not the one on the right, and nearly crashed into a wall in a stairwell that wound counterclockwise! Without paying attention to what you’re doing, this ‘default to the right’ can end up in some sticky near-collision situations!</p>
    <p><strong>2. The money looks different... in a confusing way. </strong>The NZD and CAD 20-dollar bills are nearly indistinguishable: both are the same shade of green plastic, and both feature a picture of the queen. But that’s where the similarities end! Further confusing matters is the fact that the NZ fifty is purple, and the ten is blue – which can lead to some change-ups in your wallet! (The five is orange and unlikely to be confused with anything you already had in your wallet.) If coins are of more interest, the denominations and styles are different. New Zealand coins come in 2-dollar, 1-dollar, 50-cent, 20-cent, and 10-cent denominations (so your total will be effectively rounded to the nearest dime, rather than the nearest nickel, when you pay in cash!). The 1-dollar coin looks a lot like the loonie, which begs the question: which is a cuter bird, the kiwi or the loon? Will I be disowned if I choose the kiwi?</p>
    <p><strong>3. Sustainability is a big deal here. </strong>You will be charged 50 cents for a takeout container or a plastic bag in a restaurant. Biodegradable produce bags are available for sale. Every power outlet has a switch that can be turned off when not in use. Labelling on packaging is much more straightforward and forthright – and there are a surprising number of bio-based or reusable items available for purchase, even at low-end stores. Every toilet has a low-flush option. Clearly, the country is making an effort to be as sustainable as possible – and the changes are systemic, which makes the environmentally conscious option the default. </p>
    <p><strong>4. There are public washrooms everywhere - and they're very clean. </strong>If you (like me) make a habit of drinking excessive amounts of water, you’re in luck! Walking along any of downtown Auckland’s numerous footpaths (also, incidentally, the local term for a sidewalk), you are probably no more than ten minutes away from a washroom at any given time. Furthermore, they’re kept in excellent condition – a double win!</p>
    <p><strong>5. The sun sits in the north of the sky. </strong>This is much more disorienting than it might first seem. I only realized how much I relied on the sun for navigation when I saw the sun set in an unexpected direction and realized that I expect the sun to be on my left when I face west. Now it’s on my right – so north is south and south is north and I guess things really are upside down here!</p>
    <p><strong>6. Ferries are a part of the public transit system. </strong>Because Auckland is situated on both sides of a harbour, there are many ferry services linking the suburbs on the north shore to the central business district. Accessing these boats is very straightforward – as with GO Transit in the GTA, you tap on and tap off with your ‘Presto’ (here, it’s called an AT HOP card), which allows you access to an extensive network of buses, trains, and boats! An excellent resource for a car-free Canadian!</p>
    <p><strong>7. The weather can change on a dime. </strong>For years have I carried a raincoat in my knapsack every day, fearing an unexpected downpour. What bordered on a phobia in Southern Ontario is in fact quite a reasonable concern here – sudden, and intense, rain is an everyday occurrence! People in the streets carry umbrellas like arm extensions. Fortunately, this rain often blows away as soon as it arrives, and you’re left with a brilliant blue sky!</p>
    <p><strong>8. Many of the shopping malls are open-air. </strong>When there’s no snow to consider, and winter temperatures are a balmy ten degrees, I guess you can have open-air malls and markets! These are quite neat – a city block is transformed into a network of shops, much like the PATH system under downtown Toronto – but you can feel the wind blowing between the buildings! As a pedestrian, these routes also provide an attractive alternative to walking along a busy sidewalk.</p>
    <p><strong>9. There are palm trees - in winter! </strong>If you’re from Eastern Ontario (or anywhere else in Canada, for that matter), need I say more? You might cognitively understand that it’s warm in winter – but setting your eyes on the lush green foliage, with visions of snowdrifts dancing through the back of your head, is an experience quite unlike any other!</p>
    <p><strong>10. The scenery is gorgeous - and super accessible. </strong>New Zealand is known for its many gorgeous vistas (notably those used in the Lord of the Rings films) – but nature is clearly integrated with Kiwi daily life. The parks are well-maintained and clean, with cleverly designed children’s playground equipment. From the coast, in any direction, all you can see are plants, geological features, and charming collections of buildings. Auckland’s a beautiful city, whether viewed on foot, by train, or by boat! And there are exceptionally well-labelled route signs everywhere, allowing you to navigate without ever opening a map. A world-class natural design for a city.</p>
