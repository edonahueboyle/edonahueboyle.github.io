    <p>About a month ago, my travels brought me to Winnipeg. I had flown in to present at a conference, and, for reasons that are perhaps better left to the imagination, needed to buy a pinapple to support my presentation.</p>
    <p>Off I trekked to Safeway, Western Canada's somewhat upscale grocery store. I knew walking in that produce was likely to be expensive, but SEVEN DOLLARS for a pineapple was more than I had bargained for. Maybe pineapples aren't exactly local in Manitoba.</p>
    <p>But the pineapple was an essential part of the presentation! So into the basket it went. After the talk, I tried to pawn the fruit off on a local: no takers. No one wanted it, I had no way of chopping or eating it in my hostel room, and I really didn't fancy wasting a perfectly good piece of very expensive fruit!</p>
    <p>There was only one thing to be done. Putting all the Tetris skills I had ever acquired to good use, I strapped the pineapple into my carry-on suitcase, cushioning it with socks and shirts. Then that pineapple and I went all over the city (checkout at the hostel was 10 AM, and the plane home didn't fly until late evening). And oh, the places we go-ed! We walked to the public library. We visited the Canadian Museum of Human Rights (that's the one on the ten dollar bill) and had lunch at the Forks (where the Red and Assinboine rivers meet). We travelled the entire length of the aerial walkway across the central business district.</p>

    <p>Then the pineapple and I took the bus to the airport, where our real trials began. I had no checked luggage, so my new friend needed to accompany me through security. It was a domestic flight, meaning fruit shouldn't have been an issue... or so we hoped...</p>
    <p>And yet - surprise, surprise - the suitcase was flagged.</p>
    <p>"Anything sharp in here?" The woman at security asked, feeling in the crevasses around the pinapple with gloved hands. I assured her there was not, praying that she didn't ask what the fruit was for. Telling her it was part of a chemistry project was probably begging for trouble.</p>
    <p>She sent the suitcase to be screened again. This time, I watched a bemused security crew stare at the infrared camera displaying the distinct image of a pineapple smack in the middle of my suitcase.</p>
    <p>Somehow, no further questions were asked, and the pineapple and I flew home without incident.</p>
    <p>Two days later, a friend and I chopped and ate that pineapple, reserving some for my supervisor who had sent me on the trip. After all of that trouble, you might be tempted to think that the pineapple was the best I'd ever tasted.</p>
    <p>An honest review: it was... not bad! About what you'd expect from a pineapple purchased in Winnipeg. But at least it wasn't a waste of seven dollars!</p>
