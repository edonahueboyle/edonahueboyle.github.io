    <p>At some point along your car-free journey, you may encounter an obstacle that seems truly insurmountable. Your bus might break down in the middle of nowhere. A friend might move off of a major transit line, making it very difficult for you to visit them. You might need to move a mattress two and a half kilometres on a national holiday.</p>
    <p>In either of the first two scenarios, you'll be okay - that's what bikes are for! But if you've a mattress weighing you down, here is your ultimate guide to making its transport as painless as possible.</p>
    <p><strong>1) Dress for the job.</strong> You might be tempted to think that anything is appropriate mattress-moving attire. Think again! You will want to wear long sleeves to prevent bed-sores and a hat with a narrow brim so that the mattress won't disrupt your headgear.</p>
    <p><strong>2) Find a friend.</strong> Moving a mattress is a two-person job - but your partner must be well-prepared and carefully selected. She must be strong enough to lift the mattress, she must be crazy enough not to be seen while carrying the mattress, and, crucially, she must like you enough that she will still be your friend after the mission has ended. Bonus points if she also has no car - it might tempt her to take the boring route of driving the mattress for you, and that simply won't do!</p>
    <p><strong>3) Put the mattress on your heads.</strong> Positioning is important here. I would recomment putting the taller person at the front so that she can navigate and the shorter person can see something other than the bottom of the mattress. Try to keep your heads in the centre of the mattress, lest it list to the side and your friend become angry with you.</p>
    <p><strong>4) WALK!</strong> (And walk... and walk...) The best way to move a mattress is one step at a time! Eventually, you will get into a rhythm and will really start to build up a head of steam. You may start to feel that one, or both, of your arms is going numb. Coordinating with your partner, take turns to rest one of your arms. Two hards and two arms will usually constitute sufficient mattress support when moving at a steady pace over even terrain.</p>
    <p><strong>5) Talk to your neighbours.</strong> Occasionally, some well-meaning person might take interest in the totally normal operation that you're conducting. He might even joke that you are perfectly equipped for a portable nap! As you are able, swallow your self-consciousness and try to take these jokes in stride. These conversations are good for morale, offer reprieve for your tired legs, and provide you with entertaining dinner party stories for years to come!</p>
    <p><strong>6) Cross a major highway... via an overpass, of course.</strong> You're not THAT crazy, right? The overpass allows for maximum visibility to the motorists below. At this juncture, speculations with your friend about whether you will make the evening news are not only appropriate, but encouraged.</p>
    <p><strong>7) Successfully deliver the mattress.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Collapse.</strong> Moving a mattress is hard work! Fortunately, you've provided yourself with just the perfect surface for a breather...</p>
    <p><strong>Enjoy more car-free Canada Day adventures!</strong> With all of the money you've saved on moving expenses and gas, you can probably afford a bike ride and a lemonade. What better way to celebrate a successful operation?</p>
    <p>I hope this guide proves somewhat useful when next you find yourself with a mattress to move. Please share this article with anyone in your life who might find it instructive - and I look forward to seeing you on the news!</p>
